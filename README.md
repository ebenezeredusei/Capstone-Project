# Capstone-Project

## Description
This project involved predicting the likelihood of an Expresso network customer opting for an alternative communication other thanthe services of Expresso. The Project utilized both train and test datasets consisting of 19 columns (18 for the test dataset) withe their resepective values. Also variious models were trained, and the most optimal model chosen to assist with developing a predictive web application which was hosted on Huggingface. The project used the CRISP-DM framework to analse, train models and deploy the webapplication on Huggingface

## Models Used
1. Logistics Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Decision Tree
4. Naive Baynes

These models were trained and with the train and test data sets, and the AUC, accuracy and precision score was used to evaluate them to select the best model for developing the customer churn prediction application
